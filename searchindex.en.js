Where to start We recommend that you check out our showcase to understand what you can simulate, and our tutorials to learn how to fiddle with the tool. Once you are on track, we prepared specific how-to guides for the most common operations. To better understand how the simulator works, refer to our explanation section; to master it, building your own extensions and advanced scenarios or customizing what is available, take a look to the reference.\nAlchemist for Academia If you happen to use Alchemist for academic purposes, please add a reference to the following paper:\nHere is a BibTeX for LaTeX users:\nIndex of contents TutorialsTutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps. They are meant to show a beginner that they can achieve something with Alchemist.\nQuickstartA super-fast way to get an instance of the simulator up and running.\nStep-by-step tutorialA (video) guide through the main features of the simulator, as presented at DAIS 2021\nProtelis Incarnation TutorialReady-to-run examples of increasing complexity with the Protelis incarnation\nSAPERE Incarnation TutorialReady-to-run examples of increasing complexity with the SAPERE incarnation\nScafi Incarnation TutorialReady-to-run examples of increasing complexity with the Scafi incarnation\nHow-to GuidesHow-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end: while a tutorial is what a beginner needs to know, a how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate. In how-to guides, we assume some knowledge and understanding, we assume that the user already knows how to do basic things and use basic tools.\nPreparationPreliminary operations for using Alchemist: installation, setup\nAlchemist stand-aloneThe recommended way to run the simulator and fetch all the required modules.\nAlchemist via GradleThe recommended way to run the simulator and fetch all the required modules.\nSimulationGuides on how to create simulation environments, configure node behaviour, and control the simulation details\nCreate reusable variablesDefine reusable pieces of information and compute upon them, prepare for the execution of simulation batches.\nEnsure repeatabilityControl randomness, ensuring reproducibility and replicability of experiments.\nCognitive AgentsAgents with realistic human behavior.\nCreate a networkDefine how nodes should be connected with each other.\nCreate LayersDefine data layers that live in the environment\nCreate rich environmentsHow to create complex environments (obstacles, and so on)\nFind paths indoorsHow to navigate the environment, especially indoors.\nMaps and GPS tracesHow to simulate using maps and GPS traces.\nSimulate indoorHow to create indoor environments based on planimetries.\nSimulate physical interactions among pedestriansPhysical interaction between nodes\nDeploy NodesHow to place nodes within Alchemist environments\n(Irregular) GridsDeployment of nodes in (possibly irregular) grids.\nNodes inside shapesDeployment of nodes randomly inside arbitrary shapes.\nGPS TracesDeployment of nodes on map-based environments using GPS data.\nGraphsDeployment of nodes into arbitrary graphs.\nExport dataSelect which data the simulator should output, in which format, and where.\nMonitor and Control Simulations through GraphQLMonitor and Control a Simulation through a set of GraphQL APIs.\nMonitoring Simulations through Custom Output MonitorsCreate custom monitors to track simulation progression and interact with standard hooks.\nProgram NodesHow to define the behavior of nodes\nMove nodes on mapsHow to move node around in geospatial environments.\nNode contentsDefinition of the initial content of nodes.\nSmart cameras and dronesSimulate robots with a field of view.\nExecutionExecution of multiple simulations, locally or in a distributed environment\nCustomize the Swing GUICustomize the look of your simulation.\nDefine the termination criteriaDecide when the simulator should stop and consider the simulation concluded.\nMultiVeStAHow to integrate MultiVesta in Alchemist\nParameter Sweeping with simulation batchesExecute multiple instances of a simulation with different parameters\nSimulation Engine ConfigurationAvailable simulation engine configurations.\nWorkaroundsPre-concocted solutions to well-known issues\nGraphical Glitches in SwingKnown issues with Swing and OpenGL acceleration, especially with legacy AMD/ATi drivers.\nMemory leaks under LinuxKnown issue of some Java Virtual Machine implementations when requested to use more than 64GB of RAM\nExperiment-specific extensionsOne-time changes or additions to the simulator behavior\nDevelopmentHow to contribute to the project, hence achieving eternal glory\nDeveloper's guideHow to contribute\nEnrich the GraphQL APIHow to create a new Query, Subscription, or Mutation using the GraphQL API\nImport Alchemist in an IDEThe recommended way to get and import the Alchemist project in an IDE\nBuild and run the QAHow to locally build and test the simulator\nExplanationExplanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic.

    "content": "Declaring variables The variables section lists variable simulation values. A variable defines some kind of value that can be referenced in the simulation file.\nThere are two kinds of variables: free and dependent variables. Free variables are meant to provide support for running batches of simulations with varying parameters; dependent variables are either single valued or can be computed from the values of other variables (free or dependent), and they are designed to simplify the simulation code.\nFree variables Free variables define a set of values and a default. Their main scope is enabling Alchemist to run a set of simulations with different parameters (values of variables) without the need to duplicate the simulation code. When used in this mode (called “batch mode”), Alchemist by default produces the cartesian product of all the variables values’ selected for the batch, and runs a simulation for each combination. If the simulation is not executed as batch, then the default value is used.\nLinear variables A variable generating values in a range, starting from a minimum value, and increasing by some step. Represented by LinearVariable.\nExamples Click to show / hide code incarnation: sapere variables: myvar: \u0026myvar type: LinearVariable parameters: [0, 0, 1, 0.2] Click to show / hide code incarnation: sapere variables: rate: \u0026rate type: GeometricVariable parameters: [2, 0.1, 10, 9] size: \u0026size type: LinearVariable parameters: [5, 1, 10, 1] mSize: \u0026mSize formula: -size sourceStart: \u0026sourceStart formula: mSize / 10 sourceSize: \u0026sourceSize formula: size / 5 network-model: type: ConnectWithinDistance parameters: [0.5] _send: \u0026grad - time-distribution: *rate program: \"{token, N, L} --\u003e {token, N, L} *{token, N+#D, L add [#NODE;]}\" - program: \u003e {token, N, L}{token, def: N2\u003e=N, L2} --\u003e {token, N, L} deployments: type: Grid parameters: [*mSize, *mSize, *size, *size, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] contents: type: Rectangle parameters: [*sourceStart, *sourceStart, *sourceSize, *sourceSize] molecule: token, 0, [] programs: *grad Click to show / hide code incarnation: protelis variables: zoom: \u0026zoom formula: 0.1 # Must be a valid Groovy snippet image_name: { formula: \"'chiaravalle.png'\" } image_path: \u0026image_path language: kotlin # Pick whatever JSR223 language you like and add it to the classpath formula: | # The following is pure Kotlin code.

Let’s suppose that we want to deploy on a circle, but for some reason (e.g. because it is required by the constructor of some Action) we need to compute and have available radius and perimeter. We don’t need to control both of them: the perimeter can be computed from the radius (or vice versa).\nTo favor reusability and apply the DRY principle, the simulator allows defining variables whose values possibly depend on values of other variables through JSR223Variable. Their values can be expressed, by default, in Groovy, but any JSR-223-compatible language can be used, in principle. If a compatible JSR-223 implementation of the language is available in the classpath, Alchemist will load and use it transparently. By default, groovy, kotlin (or kts), and scala are available as scripting languages for dependent variables.\nInfo The JSR-223 specification defines mechanisms allowing scripting language programs to access information developed in the Java Platform.\nMany languages (including Groovy, Python (Jython), Kotlin, and Scala provide bindings for JSR-223).\nVariables can be defined in any order. Alchemist figures out the dependencies automatically, as far as there are no cyclic dependencies (e.g. variable a requires b, and b requires a). Please note that the simulator variable dependency resolution system is not designed to solve mathematical systems, so even though the problem has a well-formed mathematical solution, the actual variable resolution may fail; e.g. if a is defined as 2 * b + 1, and b is defined as 4 - a, the system won’t bind a to 3 and b to 1, but will simply fail complaining about circular dependencies.\nMultiline programs Sometimes data manipulation can get tricky and trivial scripting may no longer be enough. In such cases, and especially with modern languages that allow for a reduced usage of cerimonial semicolons (such as Kotlin and Scala), it can be useful to write multiline programs. This can be achieved in YAML by using the pipe | operator, as exemplified in the following snippet:\nmultiline-string: | note that the string needs to be indented. Newlines will be preserved!

Randomness is controlled by setting the random generator seeds separately for the deployments and the simulation execution, allowing for running different simulations on the same random deployment.\nAlchemist simulations can be reproduced by feeding them the same random number generator. This assumption is true as far as the custom component in use:\ndo not use any other random generators but the one provided by the simulation framework (all the standard components are guaranteed to do so); do not iterate over collections with no predicible iteration order (e.g., Java’s Set and Map) containing elements (or keys) whose hashCode() has not been overridden to return the same value regardless of the specific JVM in use; do not run operations in parallel. The seeds section control the random generation process and may contain two optional values: scenario and simulation. The former is the seed of the pseudo-random generator used during the creation of the simulation, e.g. for deploying nodes in random arrangements. The latter is the seed of the pseudo-random generator used during the simulation, e.g. for computing time distributions or generating random positions.

    "content": "The first step to take in order to use the simulator, is to answer the question\nwhat does Alchemist simulate?\nA broad introduction is provided in form of introductory video from the DAIS 2021 conference tutorial.\nThe model The world of Alchemist is composed of the following entities:\nMolecule The name of a data item If Alchemist were an imperative programming language, a molecule would be the concept of variable name Concentration The value associated to a particular molecule If Alchemist were an imperative programming language, a concentration would be the concept of value associated to a variable Node A container of molecules and reactions, living inside an environment Environment The Alchemist abstration for the space. It is a container for nodes, and it is able to tell: Where the nodes are in the space - i.e. their position The distance between two nodes Optionally, support for moving nodes Linking rule A function of the current status of the environment that associates to each node a neighborhood Neighborhood An entity composed by a node (centre) and a set of nodes (neighbors) Reaction Any event that can change the status of the {{ anchor(’environment’, ‘Environment’) }} Each node has a possibly empty set of reactions Each reaction is defined by a possibly empty list of conditions, one or more actions and a {{ anchor(’time distribution’, ‘TimeDistribution’) }} The frequency at which it happens depends on: A static “rate” parameter The value of each condition A “rate equation”, that combines the static rate and the value of conditions, giving back an “instantaneous rate” A time distribution Condition A function that takes the current environment as input and outputs a boolean and a number If the condition does not hold (i.e. its current output is false), the reaction to which it is associated cannot run The outputed number may or may not influence the reaction speed (i.e. the average number of times the reaction “happens” per time unit), depending on the reaction and its time distribution. Action Models a change in the environment. The following image is a visualization of such model:\nThe behavior of the system is described in terms of reactions. As such, here’s a pictorial representation of a reaction:\nIncarnations As you can see, names are given after classical chemistry terms. This is mostly for historical reasons: Alchemist has been initially conceived as a chemical-oriented multi-compartment stochastic simulation engine, able to support compartment (node) mobility while still retaining high performance.\nHowever, Alchemist is not limited to that. The key of its extensibility is in the very loose interpretation of molecule and concentration. These two terms have a very precise definition in chemistry, but in Alchemist they are respectively\na generic identifier, and a piece of data of some type An incarnation of Alchemist includes a type definition of concentration, and possibly a set of specific conditions, actions and (rarely) environments and reactions that operate on such types. In other words, an incarnation is a concrete instance of the Alchemist meta-model. In addition, a proper Alchemist incarnation’, ‘Incarnation must also define:\nMeans for translating strings into named entities (molecules) Means for obtaining a number when given a node, a molecule and a string representing a property Means for building incarnation-specific model entities given an appropriate context and a parameter String These functionalities are required in order to support a uniform access to different incarnations.\nDifferent Incarnations can model completely different universes. For instance, if the concentration is defined as a positive integer and proper actions and conditions are provided, Alchemist becomes a stochastic simulator for chemistry featuring interconnected and mobile compartments.\nThe standalone distribution comes with:\nProtelis Incarnation SAPERE Incarnation Biochemistry Incarnation Scafi incarnation",

The expected type depends on where the class is requested. This section describes how the system works independently of the specific target type.\n(Multi)Spec\nMandatory keys Optional keys type parameters type Type: String\nThe name of an instanceable class compatible with the expected interface. It can be either the qualified name or a simple name, in the latter case the class SHOULD be located in the same package where the default alchemist implementations of the same interface live.\nIf a name includes a ., it is interpreted as a fully qualified name. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a simple name. Provided types SHOULD NOT be located in the default package.\nFor instance, if the expected type is an Action and the concrete type FooAction, FooAction SHOULD be located into package it.unibo.alchemist.model.actions.\nparameters Type: List or Map\nThe list of parameters the constructor of type should be passed. Alchemist automatically provides contextual information to the constructors: for instance, if an Action is being built, the loading system is aware of the current RandomGenerator, Incarnation, Environment, Deployment, Node, TimeDistribution, and Reaction, as the action requires all of them. Consequently, all parameters of these types SHOULD NOT be manually specified (on the other hand, the syntax is built to make it very difficult to do by mistake). The constructor MAY fail if they are provided.\nIf a Map is provided instead of a List, then the keys are interpred as the parameter names, and their associated values as the corresponding parameter values. Since Java 11 does not support named arguments, this special invocation type is built around the Kotlin reflection, thus, the concrete class whose constructor is being invoked MUST be written in Kotlin.\nWhen using named arguments, if at least one optional parameter is specified, then all the previous optional parameters MUST be specified as well. This limitation is due to the fact that Alchemist supports loading of JVM classes regardless of their origin language, and, thus, the simulator must leverage constructor overloading to emulate optional parameters. In the case of Kotlin classes, because of the way @JvmOverloads works, only a (reasonable) subset of all possible overloads gets generated, and they differ by parameter count.\nInstantiation is delegated to the Java Implicit Reflective Factory.\nExamples Construction of a Point Click to show / hide code incarnation: protelis deployments: type: Point parameters: [0, 0] Construction of variables with named parameters Click to show / hide code incarnation: sapere network-model: { type: ConnectWithinDistance, parameters: [0.5] } deployments: type: GraphStreamDeployment parameters: nodeCount: 1000 offsetX: -10 offsetY: 10 zoom: 100 layoutQuality: 0.2 generatorName: Lobster createLinks: true parameters: [5, 15] Counter-examples The following simulation fails on loading, as BidimensionalGaussianLayer has the first and last parameters marked as optional: in order to provide the latter, the designer must also provide the former.

    "content": "In this page, we show an up to date version the examples that are presented in the tutorial paper presented at DAIS 2021 (one of the three conferences of DisCoTec 2021).\nThis tutorial features some companion videos, embedded in this page.\nInfo The tutorial is also available as a scientific document: Info All code has been open-sourced and it is being actively maintained on GitHub\nWarning Snapshots presented here are from the Java Swing GUI module that was the main UI at the time the tutorial was written, and may or may not reflect the current graphical appearance of the examples (which can be configured in any case).\nTip Simulations in alchemist are written in YAML. YAML is pretty intuitive, it can be learnt quickly through Learn X in Y minutes Where X=yaml. Even without any prior knowledge, looking at the syntax and comparing it with the information in the aforementioned page should provide enough information.\nImport the infrastructure Warning You need to be able to import an existing Gradle project from GitHub. If you have no idea of what I’m talking about, take a step back and make sure you followed the quickstart.\ngit clone https://github.com/DanySK/DisCoTec-2021-Tutorial.git cd DisCoTec-2021-Tutorial Unix-like terminals: ./gradlew run00 Windows terminals (cmd, Powershell): gradlew.bat run00 The shell should begin to work, download the required components, and pop a graphical interface in front of you.\nNote If something went wrong, let us know by opening an issue!\nThe build system is continuous-integration sensitive. If a GUI is not displayed but the proces terminates successfully, make sure that you do not have a CI environment variable set to true.\nWriting and launching simple simulations In this video you will see how to:\nimport the example project, and how to use it to run simulations; write simple simulations in YAML; deploy nodes into a bidimensional space; and write programs that perform manipulation of data in form of tuples. Note This is actually the second video of the tutorial. The first presents introductory information on the simulator and its meta-model, it can be found in the Explanation chapter of the documentation.\nThe examples presented in the video are presented in the following subsections, updated to execute with the latest version of the simulator. You will find this code in the current version of the tutorial.\nTip Make changes to the existing configuration files and see what happens!\nThree connected devices In this simple example, we simply deploy three nodes in a bidimensional space. They do nothing, they are just there. Starting the simulation would make it go to infinite time instantly, as there are no events to simulate.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: sapere # The incarnation is always mandatory network-model: type: ConnectWithinDistance # Loads a class with this name implementing LinkingRule parameters: [2] # Connection radius (parameter of a ConnectWithinDistance's constructor) deployments: - type: Point # Loads a class with this name implementing Deployment parameters: [0, 0] # Coordinates - { type: Point, parameters: [0.5, 0.85] } - { type: Point, parameters: [-0.5, 0.85] } The graphic effect is just to see three dots in the interface. If links are displayed (see the reference of the graphical interface), then the three nodes appear linked. Show snapshot A grid of devices playing dodgeball In this example we create a grid of devices and make them play dodgeball. The program to be injected is rather simple: some nodes will begin the simulation with a ball, and their goal will be to throw it to a random neighbor; whichever node gets hit takes a point, updates its score, and throws the ball again. This program is easy to write in a network of programmable tuple spaces, hence we write the following specification using the SAPERE incarnation.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: sapere network-model: { type: ConnectWithinDistance, parameters: [0.5] } deployments: type: Grid parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] # A perturbed grid of devices contents: - molecule: \"{hit, 0}\" # Everywhere, no one has been hit - in: { type: Rectangle, parameters: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1] } # Inside this shape... molecule: ball # ...every node has a ball programs: - time-distribution: 1 # This is a frequency, time distribution type is left to the incarnation # 'program' specs are passed down to the incarnation for being interpreted as reactions program: \"{ball} {hit, N} --\u003e {hit, N + 1} {launching}\" # If hit, count the hit - program: \"{launching} --\u003e +{ball}\" # As soon as possible, throw the ball to a neighbor Snapshots of the simulation of the “dodgeball” example follow. Devices with a ball are depicted in black. All other devices’ color hue depends on the hit count, shifting from red (zero hits) towards blue.\nShow snapshots A gradient on a grid of devices In this example, we implement with the SAPERE incarnation a very simple specification of a gradient, a pattern that is considered to be the basis of many other patterns 1\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: sapere network-model: { type: ConnectWithinDistance, parameters: [0.5] } deployments: type: Grid parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] contents: in: { type: Rectangle, parameters: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1] } molecule: source # Here is the source of the gradient programs: - time-distribution: 0.1 # Exponential with λ=0.1 # If there is a source, then the gradient is zero. program: \"{source} --\u003e {source} {gradient, 0}\" - time-distribution: 1 # Exponential distribution with λ=1 # Send all neighbors your gradient value plus one program: \"{gradient, N} --\u003e {gradient, N} *{gradient, N+1}\" # In case of multiple gradients, take the shortest - program: \"{gradient, N}{gradient, def: N2\u003e=N} --\u003e {gradient, N}\" - time-distribution: 0.1 program: \"{gradient, N} --\u003e {gradient, N + 1}\" # Aging process - program: \"{gradient, def: N \u003e 30} --\u003e\" # Death process Here are some snapshots of the simulation of the “gradient” example. Source devices have a central black dot. Devices’ color hue depends on the gradient value, shifting from red (low) towards blue (high).\nShow snapshots Arbitrary network graphs This example showcases some complex deployments made possible by Alchemist via Graphstream\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: sapere network-model: { type: ConnectWithinDistance, parameters: [0.5] } deployments: - { type: GraphStreamDeployment, parameters: [300, -30, 0, 0.8, Lobster, [5, 15]] } - { type: GraphStreamDeployment, parameters: [300, 0, 0, 2, BananaTree, 10] } - { type: GraphStreamDeployment, parameters: [300, 30, 0, PreferentialAttachment] } The example creates a single environment with three advanced deployments. From left to right: a Lobster graph, a banana tree, and a scale-free network with preferential attachment.\nAdvanced examples In this video, we learn how to:\nuse aggregate programming (via Protelis) to write simulations; use images to create indoor environments with physical obstacles; use OpenStreetMap data to simulate on real-world maps; and export data from simulations and configure batches exploring all possible combinations Node mobility and indoor environments Many interesting scenarios the simulator targets require mobility and a richer environment. In the following example, we show a group of mobile devices estimating the distance from a point of interest (the altar) while moving within a church, whose planimetry has been taken from an existing building. Since the gradient is propagated in a network of mobile devices, we use a Protelis implementation of the adaptive Bellman-Ford algorithm from the Protelis-lang library2\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: { type: ImageEnvironment, parameters: [chiaravalle.png, 0.1] } network-model: { type: ObstaclesBreakConnection, parameters: [50] } deployments: type: Rectangle parameters: [300, 62, 15, 95, 200] programs: - time-distribution: 1 program: \u003e import protelis:coord:spreading let source = [110, 325] let vector = self.getCoordinates() - source let distance = hypot(vector.get(0), vector.get(1)) distanceTo(distance \u003c 50) - program: send # Actual network message delivery - type: Event time-distribution: 1 actions: { type: LevyWalk, parameters: [1.4] } In the following snapshots, mobile devices progressively explore the location, while measuring the distance from a point of interest via gradient (red nodes are closer to the point of interest; purple ones are farther).\nShow snapshots Real-world maps and GPS traces The simulator can load data from OpenStreetMap exports, navigate devices towards a destination along streets by relying on GraphHopper or by using GPS traces in GPX format, or even using the navigation system to interpolate sparse GPS traces, thus preventing nodes from taking impossible paths. In the following simple scenario buoys are deployed in the Venice lagoon and move Brownianly.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: sapere environment: { type: OSMEnvironment } network-model: { type: ConnectWithinDistance, parameters: [1000] } _venice_lagoon: \u0026lagoon [[45.2038121, 12.2504425], [45.2207426, 12.2641754], [45.2381516, 12.2806549], [45.2570053, 12.2895813], [45.276336, 12.2957611], [45.3029049, 12.2991943], [45.3212544, 12.3046875], [45.331875, 12.3040009], [45.3453893, 12.3040009], [45.3502151, 12.3156738], [45.3622776, 12.3232269], [45.3719259, 12.3300934], [45.3830193, 12.3348999], [45.395557, 12.3445129], [45.3998964, 12.3300934], [45.4018249, 12.3136139], [45.4105023, 12.3122406], [45.4167685, 12.311554], [45.4278531, 12.3012543], [45.4408627, 12.2902679], [45.4355628, 12.2772217], [45.4206242, 12.2703552], [45.3994143, 12.2744751], [45.3738553, 12.2676086], [45.3579354, 12.2614288], [45.3429763, 12.2497559], [45.3198059, 12.2408295], [45.2975921, 12.2346497], [45.2802014, 12.2408295], [45.257972, 12.233963], [45.2038121, 12.2504425]] deployments: type: Polygon parameters: [500, *lagoon] programs: - time-distribution: 10 type: Event actions: { type: BrownianMove, parameters: [0.0005]} The following snapshots depict the simulation in execution.\nShow snapshots In-depth analysis of simulated scenarios The following snippet showcases the aforementioned features by enriching the example of a gradient in an indoor environment presented previously with:\nvariables for the pedestrian walking speed, pedestrian count, and random seed; constants to ease the configuration of the simulation; a Kotlin resource search expressed as a variable; controlled reproducibility by controlling random seeds; export of generated data (time and several statistics on the gradient).

The traditional approach is to gather information into sparse collector devices by relying on hop-by-hop accumulation, but issues of reactivity and fragility naturally arise in scenarios with high mobility. We propose novel algorithms for dynamic data summarisation across space, supporting high reactivity and resilience by specific techniques maximising the speed at which information propagates towards collectors. Such algorithms support idempotent and arithmetic aggregation operators and, under reasonable network assumptions, are proved to achieve optimal reactivity. We provide evaluation via simulation: first in multiple scenarios showing improvement over the state of art, and then by a case study in edge data mining, which conveys the practical impact in higher-level distributed sensing patterns.\nExperiment description To exemplify practical applications, we test the proposed algorithms in a realistic setup of mobile edge computing. We focus on crowd tracking, the process of monitoring the evolution of large assembles of people, with the goal of keeping crowd density under control to prevent dangerous situations. We shall show how such monitoring can be performed fully at the edge of the network. Consider a scenario of crowd tracking in the Italian city of Turin,7 especially pushed after the famous June 2017 incident, when a panic wave and stampede emerged resulting in casualties and injuries [19]. We set up a large event in the popular public park “Parco del Valentino”, with an area of roughly . Suppose a small fraction of participants are equipped with wearable devices given by the organisation, capable of local peer-to-peer communication.\nAs reference hardware, we model the communication capabilities of the DecaWave DWM1001 Development Board.8,9 The board features two radio devices, based respectively on Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) and on a custom implementation of an Ultrawide Band (UWB) transceiver (IEEE 802.15.4-2011). The BTLE radio is used to exchange identification beacons, while the UWB module is used to communicate directly with devices in proximity, creating a mesh network. The current implementation reaches a communication range of several tenths of metres, and a data rate in the order of few megabits per second. The device is designed to be easily attachable to small-size, low-power ARM boards, such as the Raspberry PI zero, with enough computational power to sustain a full fledged operating system such as Android or GNU/Linux.\nIn our scenario, nine edge servers are displaced at key locations in the park corresponding to existing facilities. The system goal is to provide edge servers with data for predicting the evolution of the local crowd movement, so that field operators can be informed timely about risky situations. Devices can access their position with reasonable accuracy. Our goal is to estimate the density and barycentre of the local crowd in order to detect risky areas. We run an estimation of the local density, and propagate a warning to devices in potentially risky areas: such data can be used to generate short- and mid-terms density estimates [20].\nThe case study has been open-sourced for reproducibility, configured with a continuous integration system, and released as DOI objects [21]. Table 3 summarises all the variables, constants, and metrics. To challenge our proposed algorithms, we include three elements of realism and a disturbance: (1) a packet loss model, with the probability of a packet not being received growing with distance; (2) variability in the device working frequency, to emulate unpredicted scheduling policies, e.g., for battery saving; (3) people are not stationary, but move towards random waypoints within the park at a speed of [22]; (4) once the system initial transient is terminated, we progressively turn off all edge servers, shutting down one edge server every 100 s. We measure two parameters: the probability that a device is found in an area where density is growing towards a potentially dangerous level (), and the overall error of the system in identifying the barycentre of the tracked crowd (), compared to the value produced by an oracle.\nSnapshots",

Digitalized buildings, communities of people, and cities will be the next-generation “hardware and platform”, counting myriads of interconnected devices, on top of which intrinsically-distributed computational processes will run and self-organize. They will spontaneously spawn, diffuse to pertinent logical/physical regions, cooperate and compete, opportunistically summon required resources, collect and analyze data, compute results, trigger distributed actions, and eventually decay. How would a programming model for such ecosystems look like? Based on research findings on self-adaptive/self-organizing systems, the paper proposes design abstractions based on “dynamic decentralization domains”: regions of space opportunistically formed to support situated recognition and action. We embody the approach into a Scala application program interface (API) enacting distributed execution and show its applicability in a case study of environmental monitoring.\nExperiment description In the simulation presented in the paper we want to monitor the rain intensity to pre-alert the public safety organizations close to areas at a risk of floods.\nThe tracked phenomenon is spatially and temporally hard to predict with fine-enough grain (data from the NOAA1 has, at best, zip-code gran- ularity): at a single-city level, we could perform better by promptly reacting to specialized sensors readings. However, the information provided by individual sensors is too fragile, as the risk depends on the rain intensity in surroundings and not just on the specific spot (e.g., coastal zones with a steep elevation profiles could suffer floods even with light rain, if the close-by higher-altitude zone is being hit hard). Pre-defining areas (using pre-existing altimetric and structural knowledge) helps, but this strategy misses out on essential information: how the underlying phenomenon is behaving. Indeed, areas should be formed ad-hoc considering the city structure and rain distribution, and leveraged to perform on-the-fly situation recognition and response. This approach is practical whenever there are phenomena with non-strictly-local effects, irregularly shaped in space, and/or hard-to-predict a fine grain.\nFor the simulation of rain intensity, we used open data of Toronto, featuring 50 water gauges samples taken in 2021. To stress-test our proposed approach with a denser network of devices, we added 300 simulated gauges, randomly positioned, whose data is interpolated from the values of the surrounding real devices. We selected the rain event that occurred on 2021-09-07, the heaviest in the available data. We used data from OpenStreetMap to position 24 fire stations In the experiment, devices compute their programs unsynchronized at a frequency of 1Hz. We define a simple metric for the actual risk of a location as the quotient of the local rain intensity on the local altitude (namely, the rainier and the lower the position, the higher the risk); we run an oracle measuring it with a fine grain across the city at each instant. As performance measure, we count how many alerts get generated and how many stations they reach. Additional gauges position and device timing drift are randomized.\nSnapshots Darker shadows indicate heavier rain. Black squares with a small red dot are unalerted fire stations, when at least an alert reaches them, their dot changes to a large red square. Circles represent gauges; their colors map the region they are subject to when measuring rainfall intensity.\nVideo",

If you want to have a look at the project, please check the ICPS-MicroCity organization.\nAbstract The aim of this simulation is to determine whether or not a situated recommendation system can positively affect the visitor flow in an amusement park. Since the desired system does not exist, and it would be too costly to implement just for the sake of a proof of concept, we performed our validation via a simulation.\nAmusement parks are a popular form of entertainment for people with diverse ages and interests. As such, they offer several attractions, depending on the park target and theme, which may include roller-coasters, carousels, and water slides, and so on. This is one of the reasons why, especially during holidays, these parks attract a considerable amount of visitors and tend to be significantly crowded. Excessive crowding may result in situations far from ideal for visitors, as chances are that they will have to spend most of their time waiting in queue. This situation becomes even more unattractive for large groups of visitors, such as families with children, or in case of unpleasant weather conditions, such as rain or summer heat. Ultimately, a bad experience with the park may reflect into bad reviews, and hurt the business. In order to improve the overall visitors’ experience, the situated recommendation system could suggest the most suitable attractions for them.\nIn this scenario, it could be useful to recommend the most suitable attraction to visitors depending on their physical location (as tracked by their personal wearable device) and/or on their interests. The recommendations may point to the nearest attraction that suits the visitor’s preferences or to an attraction with a short queue (compared to the usual queue for the same game or to the queues of other attractions). This mechanism could be referred as situated recommendation.\nExperiment description To run a realistic setup, we used an existing amusement park: Mirabilandia. Thus, the simulated environment is a real-world map featuring existing paths.\nAfter setting the OpenStreetMap environment, it is essential to deploy nodes on the map. In the current simulation, the elements that are represented by nodes are:\nVisitors, as single individuals or groups; the key point here is that a node should correspond to one or more people using a single wearable device that tracks and guides its owner. Attractions, that can be of different types, such as rides, water slides, restaurants, etc.; they are considered rendezvous points for visitors and are made of several sensors that allow keeping track of various information, such as the number of people waiting in a queue. As previously described, the aim of this simulation is to determine whether a situated recommendation system may help reduce the waiting time needed to benefit from an attraction. In order to achieve this, the project develops and compares two types of simulations with different redirection policies for the visitors:\nRandom Redirection: once a visitor is satisfied by an attraction, it moves towards another attraction which is chosen randomly among all the ones available in the park. Recommended Redirection: once a visitor is satisfied by an attraction, it moves towards the next one accepting a recommendation. The latter may suggest an attraction if it has a short queue and/or if it is close enough to the visitor. Snapshots Results The outcomes of the experiment showed that the situated recommendation system behaves differently depending on the number of visitors. In particular, the expected result is obtained with a lower number of visitors, such as 500. On the other hand, with an higher number, that is 3000 visitors, the average waiting time per attraction increases significantly when using the situated recommendations. The following plots show the average waiting time per attraction, that is the time every visitor waits in a queue before attending the attraction, respectively with 500 and 3000 visitors.",

A crowd assembled in front of a public screen to watch the UEFA Champions Leaugue final match (involving a local team). At some point, an event of panic happened (some sources report that some firecrackers went off, others that a group of four robbers used pepper spray). The panic resulted in over 1500 injured people and 2 casualties.\nFirst, we introduced cognitive agents in the simulator to have a representation of the psicological aspects of a pedestrians such as social contagion. Then, we gave those agents the ability of orienting themselves in an environment having different knoledge degrees of the environment. Finally, we introduced elements of physical micro-interaction in order to bring out typicall behaviors such as avoidance and pushing.\nSimulation description For this simulation we placed over 40,000 cognitive nodes on a reproduction of Piazza San Carlo’s map. These nodes represent adults and childs of male and female genders. After that, we placed a “danger zone” at the point where, analyzing the available footages of the tragedy, we deduced that the mass hysteria had begun. We also included rough representations of the barriers using fixed obstacles.\nResults After executing the simulation we can observe how fear is spread amoung the crowd (social contagion). Fleeing pedestrian who have directly witnessed the danger are pushing the other who have not directly seen the danger. This result is the formation of a “pushing wave” similar to the one visibile on the real disaster footage. Looking at some of the various exits from the Squar,e it also possible to observe the so-called Faster is slower effect.\nRelated readings Cognitive agents Orienting agents",

    "content": "Simulation and detailed description publicly available at https://github.com/angelacorte/vmc-experiments, related to the paper ``An Aggregate Vascular Morphogenesis Controller for Engineered Self-Organising Spatial Structures’’ presented at ACSOS 2024 (DOI available soon).\nAbstract In the field of evolutionary computing, the concept of Vascular Morphogenesis Controller (VMC) has been proposed in to model the growth of artificial structures over time.\nA thorough analysis of the VMC model revealed some limitations:\nassumes the organization structure is a tree, here intended as a directed acyclic graph with a single root and with a single path connecting the root with each leaf; the model is implicitly synchronous, as it assumes that (i) the evaluation of the nodes must proceed from the leaves to the root (and back), and (ii) the update of the whole tree occurs atomically. Although, depending on the context, these assumptions may be acceptable, in general they may induce (possibly hidden) abstraction gaps when VMC is used to model real-world systems, and, at the same time, limit the applicability of the pattern to engineered morphogenetic systems.\nTo address these limitations, in this work, we propose FieldVMC: a generalisation of the VMC model as a field-based computation, in the spirit of the Aggregate Programming (AP) paradigm.\nExperiment description The experiments want to show the capabilities of the proposed model in generating self-organising spatial structures.\nThe goal of this evaluation is to show that the proposed FieldVMC supports the construction of the same structures of its predecessor, and, in addition, that it can work in scenarios not previously investigated. To this end, we designed a set of five experiments:\noneRoot: self-construction from a single node (growth from seed), cutting: self-repair after disruption (network segmentation) with no regeneration (cutting). The segmentation is performed by removing a part of the structure after 500 simulated seconds, and the nodes are not able to regenerate the missing part; graft: self-integration of multiple FieldVMC systems (grafting). Two distinct structures are created, and after 500 simulated seconds, they are merged into a single structure; graftWithMoreLeaders: self-segmentation of a larger structure (budding). Two distinct structures are created with possibly more than leader each; after 500 simulated seconds, they are merged into a single structure; graftWithSpawning: self-optimization of multiple large structures into a more efficient one (abscission and regrowth). Two distinct structures are created, and after 500 simulated seconds, they are merged into a single structure. During the simulation, nodes are able to spawn new nodes and destroy the ones that are not useful anymore, resulting in an optimized structure. Results In all the experiments, the cyan area represents the resource and the yellow area is the success, with darker shades indicating higher values. Nodes are represented as circles. The root is identified by a dark outer circumference.\nThe size of a circle depends on the amount of resource and success received relative to all other nodes in the system: we fix the maximum possible size $D$, we compute the maximum amount of resource $R$ and the maximum amount of success $S$ across all nodes in the system; then, for each node in the system with success $s$ and resource $r$, we determine its size $d$ proportionally to $D$ as $d=\\frac{D (r + s)}{R + S}$. Their color depends on the amount of resource nodes have and is assigned based on the hue of the HSV color space, with the most resource associated with indigo, and the lowest with red.\nDashed lines are communication channels, solid black lines represent the tree structure, and green (resp. orange) lines depict the resource (resp. success) distribution flows, the thicker they are, the more resource (resp. success) is being transferred.\nSome examples of the generated structures are shown below:\nStarting Structure Self-Organised Structure Structure after cutting a part of it Self-Organised Structure after the cutting The images show the evolution of a structure from a starting configuration to a self-organized structure, after a part of the structure has been removed.\nAs seen in the sequence below, the structure evolves from a single node to a more complex structure. Firstly, the structure results to expand towards the center of the available resources. This happens because the spawned nodes are in a zone with higher resources, used as weight in the leader election phase, thus the newly created node gets elected as the new leader, which results in an expansion towards the center of the resource layer. While the root gains more resources, nodes will spawn children based on their local success, meaning that the nodes which sense more success from the environment have higher probability and capabilities to spawn new children, resulting in an expansion towards the center of the success layer. The structure then stabilizes in what appears to be the optimal configuration, and the structure stops evolving.\nSequence of images showing the evolution in time of the structure in the oneRoot experiment.",

Numerous wildlife behavioral studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of UAVs for collecting video data of group-living animals. However, in contrast with well-established techniques for static video acquisition, the deployment of UAVs for wildlife video acquisition requires human operators to manually control and coordinate the drones while minimizing disturbance to animals. To scale UAVs missions to obtain sufficient spatiotemporal resolution, reliance on manual operations is impractical. In this paper, we present a decentralized multi-drone coordination system for wildlife video acquisition using UAVs that leverages a novel k-coverage algorithm specifically designed to cover herds. In particular, it is based on a hierarchical clustering approach to find the herds' centroids, then it coordinates multiple drones in a decentralized fashion to cover them from multiple points of view. We introduce a set of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach via simulation, finding that the proposed approach improves noticeably over the present state of the art.\nSimulation description We evaluate our decentralized multi-drone coordination system for wildlife video acquisition via simulation, comparing it to the current state of the art in the OMOkC problem considering both the quality of the footage and the noise pollution generated by the drones.\nWe chose zebras as target animals, as they are group-living animals known to form herds. Zebras are a common target for wildlife monitoring, and their behavior is well-documented, including recent drone studies.\nWe place UAVs close together in a circular zone with a 200m radius, simulating the mission as starting from a random location in the operation area. The UAVs have a communication range of 1km and move at a maximum speed of $10 \\frac{m}{s}$. Their FoV is parametrized with $R = 100m$, $B = 18m$, $\\beta = 80°$; these values were selected to match those of a commercially available quadcopter.\nPeriodically, with a frequency of 1Hz, the drones execute a loop of the tracking algorithm to select their target. We compared four tracking algorithms:\nsm_av: selects the target closest to the drone; ff_lin_pro: the current best-performing algorithm for distributed OMOkC, which builds and solves a local optimization problem to attribute targets to UAVs; bc_re_c: an extension to the original bc_re algorithm that selects the targets with the worst coverage, equipped with the clustering mechanisms to work on cluster centroids instead; ff_lin_pro_c: a variant of ff_lin_pro algorithm that includes clustering. We investigate a single video acquisition session with the drones operating for 30 simulated minutes.\nThe performance of various algorithms for wildlife tracking is analyzed, highlighting their effectiveness in different scenarios. The original ff_lin_pro algorithm, known for its success in classic OMOkC scenarios, performs poorly in wildlife tracking. However, when adapted with a problem-specific clustering system (ff_lin_pro_c), it outperforms all other algorithms. Detailed results show that while ff_lin_pro achieves better field-of-view (FoV) distance by focusing on tracked animals, it compromises overall coverage.\nWith herd knowledge added, FoV distance worsens due to a broader inclusion of animals in the scene. The proposed ff_lin_pro_c approach scales well with the number of cameras and performs best for 1- and 3-coverage with sufficient UAVs. Despite higher noise levels from closer UAV positioning, the noise remains within acceptable limits for wildlife monitoring.\nSnapshots",

It provides a pre-configured gradle build.\nThis project is a quick start for the Alchemist simulator, it shows how to use the simulator via Gradle to run a simple simulation. More information can be found on the official Alchemist website.\nPrerequisites A Gradle-compatible Java version.\nHow to launch To run the example you can rely on the pre-configured Gradle build script. It will automatically download all the required libraries, set up the environment, and execute the simulator via command line for you. As first step, use git to locally clone this repository.\nSimulations can be included in the src/main/yaml folder, and executed via the runAll Gradle task.\nFor each YAML file in src/main/yaml a task runFileName will be created.\nIn order to launch, open a terminal and move to the project root folder, then on UNIX:\n./gradlew runAll On Windows:\ngradlew.bat runAll Press \u003ckb\u003eP\u003c/kb\u003e to start the simulation. For further information about the gui, see the Alchemist documentation.\nNote that the first launch will take some time, since Gradle will download all the required files. They will get cached in the user's home folder (as per Gradle normal behavior).\nThe build script Let's explain how things work by looking at the build.gradle.kts script and the gradle/libs.versions.toml file. The latter is a Gradle dependency catalog file including the specification of the required libraries, including their name, their version, and how they get bundled; while the former is the actual script that launches the simulator.\nThe build script imports the bundled alchemist dependencies as:\ndependencies { implementation(libs.bundles.alchemist) } You will either need to import the full version of alchemist (but it's not recommended, as it pulls in a lot of dependencies you probably don't want), or manually declare which modules you want to include into your Alchemist simulations.\nAt the very least, you want to pull in an incarnation. This can be done directly in the build file, or (recommended way) through the TOML catalog.\nFor instance, let's say that you want to pull in the module for simulating on real-world maps, and that you also need a library named bar at version 1.2.3, from group io.github.foo, available on Maven Central. You could import both of them by changing the catalog as follows:\n[versions] alchemist = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;the version of alchemist is here\u0026gt;\u0026#34; [libraries] alchemist = { module = \u0026#34;it.unibo.alchemist:alchemist\u0026#34;, version.ref = \u0026#34;alchemist\u0026#34; } alchemist-incarnation-protelis = { module = \u0026#34;it.unibo.alchemist:alchemist-incarnation-protelis\u0026#34;, version.ref = \u0026#34;alchemist\u0026#34; } alchemist-swingui = { module = \u0026#34;it.unibo.alchemist:alchemist-swingui\u0026#34;, version.ref = \u0026#34;alchemist\u0026#34; } # The following two lines are additions, the first defines the maps module of alchemist... alchemist-maps = { module = \u0026#34;it.unibo.alchemist:alchemist-maps\u0026#34;, version.ref = \u0026#34;alchemist\u0026#34; } # ...the second the custom library with a more compact syntax as there is no need to reuse the version defined above. foobar = \u0026#34;io.github.foo:bar:1.2.3\u0026#34; [bundles] alchemist = [ \u0026#34;alchemist\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alchemist-incarnation-protelis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alchemist-swingui\u0026#34;, # Adding the newly defined libraries to the alchemist bundle makes them available automatically \u0026#34;alchemist-maps\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34; ] The build script defines some tasks meant to run Alchemist from the command line through Gradle with ease. There will be one task for each simulation file in src/main/yaml, dynamically detected and prepared by Gradle. You can see a summary of the tasks for running Alchemist by issuing ./gradlew tasks --all (or gradlew.bat tasks --all under Windows) and looking for the Run Alchemist task group.\nInternally, the task relies on the Alchemist command-line interface. Alchemist simulations are YAML files, more information about them can be found here.\nInfo Although Alchemist requires Java 11 or above to run, Gradle users can rely on any Gradle-compatible Java version and leverage the Gradle toolchains to obtain an Alchemist-compatible Java Virtual Machine.",

    "content": "Alchemist is capable of simulating the movement of pedestrians with sophisticated cognitive capabilities:\nThe animation above shows an adult male with no previous knowledge of the environment trying to reach the destination marked green.\nTypes of pedestrian There are three basic types of pedestrian, each representing a more sophisticated version of the previous one. These are derived from the work of van der Wal et al.\nHomogeneous Pedestrians: Nodes with no peculiar characteristic. Heterogeneous pedestrians have an age and a gender, based on which their speed, compliance to rules, and social attitudes are computed. Cognitive pedestrians are heterogeneous pedestrians with cognitive capabilities. They have an emotional state and are able to influence and be influenced by others with the same capabilities. As an example, cognitive pedestrians can perceive fear via social contagion (e.g. seeing other people fleeing may cause them flee as well regardless of whether they’ve seen the danger directly). Orienting pedestrians, as shown in the animation on the top of the page, can be equipped with different knowledge degrees of the environment. To do so, a particular type of pedestrian called orienting pedestrian is required: this is derived from the work of Andresen et al. Types of behaviors There are two macro-categories of behaviours:\nthose inspired to Reynold’s steering behaviors, which operate in a greedy fashion, i.e. performing only local choices; those inspired to the work of Andresen et al, which exploit the spatial information available to orienting pedestrians in order to navigate the environment consciously (e.g. without getting stuck in U-shaped obstacles). Note that these actions do not assume that pedestrians have global knowledge of the environment, on the contrary only the spatial information available to a pedestrian is used to move it (which can be little or nothing). Navigation memory model Each time a pedestrian enters a new room (= environment’s area), all the visible doors are weighted, the one with minimum weight is then crossed. The weighting system used in Alchemist is derived from the one by Andresen et al, here’s a brief description of the factors included, these are multiplied to get the final weight.\nName Description volatileMemoryFactor Takes into account the information stored in the pedestrian’s volatile memory (= a map pairing each room with the number of visits, models the ability to remember areas of the environment already visited since the start of the simulation). It is computed as 2^v where v is the number of visits to the area the edge being weighted leads to (in other words, less visited rooms are preferred). congestionFactor Takes into account the congestion of the area the edge being weighted leads to (it is assumed that the pedestrian can estimate the congestion level of a neighboring room). It is computed as density of the area + 1, so as to have a value in [1,2] (less crowded rooms are preferred). impasseFactor Takes into account whereas a door leads to a known impasse or not, known impasses are given knownImpasseWeight (see hardcoded parameters below), otherwise this factor assumes unitary value. suitabilityFactor This factor is used when the pedestrian is moving towards a target: each door is given an integer rank indicating its suitability in order to reach the target (ranks are computed taking into account the target and the door locations, as well as the geometry of the current room). The factor for each door is computed as 1-0.5^rank. Physical pedestrians Physical pedestrians are capable of pushing and bumping into each other. Physical pedestrians are inspired to the work of Pelechano et al.\nFurther references C. Natalie van der Wal, Daniel Formolo, Mark A.

Common properties concern abilities such as perceiving other nodes (PerceptiveProperty) and occuping space in an environment (OccupiesSpaceProperty).\nHomogeneous Pedestrian As shown in the example below, this kind of pedestrian is obtained by attaching the Pedestrian property.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: type: ContinuousPhysics2DEnvironment deployments: - type: Circle parameters: [100, 0, 0, 20] properties: - type: Pedestrian - type: Perceptive2D - type: CircularArea - type: Social Heterogeneous Pedestrian The age groups available are: child, adult, and elderly; alternatively, if the exact age is specified, they are assigned to one of the aforementioned groups automatically.

As an example, cognitive pedestrians can perceive fear via social contagion (e.g. seeing other people fleeing may cause them flee as well despite they haven’t directly seen the danger).

Such quantity is a Double value in [0,1] describing the percentage of environment the pedestrian is familiar with prior to the start of the simulation (thus it does not take into account the knowledge the pedestrian will gain during it). Note that despite their name (“homogeneous”), knowledge degrees of different homogeneous orienting pedestrians may differ, and even pedestrians with the same knowledge degree can be different as each one can be familiar with different portions of the environment. Be also aware that orienting pedestrians can only be placed in an EnvironmentWithGraph which is a type of environment providing a navigation graph.

The only way you can currently assign a group to a pedestrian is by creating it as a variable and passing it as a parameter when the Nodes created are of pedestrian type. If you don’t specify any group in this phase, automatically a new group of type Alone is assigned.\nThe following simulation example loads two groups of homogeneous pedestrians representing friends around the center of the scene, one having 10 members and the other 15.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: type: ContinuousPhysics2DEnvironment variables: group1: \u0026group1 formula: it.unibo.alchemist.model.cognitive.groups.GroupFactory.friends() language: kotlin group2: \u0026group2 formula: it.unibo.alchemist.model.cognitive.groups.GroupFactory.friends() language: kotlin deployments: - type: Circle parameters: [10, 0, 0, 20] properties: - type: Pedestrian - type: Perceptive2D - type: CircularArea - type: Social parameters: [*group1] - type: Circle parameters: [15, 0, 0, 20] properties: - type: Pedestrian - type: Perceptive2D - type: CircularArea - type: Social parameters: [*group2] Steering Actions Steering actions are Actions whose purpose is moving a node inside an environment. These actions can be divided into two categories:\ngreedy, i.e. performing only local choices; NavigationActions, which exploit the spatial information available to orienting pedestrians in order to navigate the environment consciously (e.g. without getting stuck in U-shaped obstacles). For a complete overview of the available actions refer to the api documentation. The creation of complex movements can be accomplished by combining different steering actions together. The only way currently available to do so is by using some SteeringBehavior extending Reaction, which can recognize, across all the actions specified, the steering ones to trait them in a separate way.\nIn this simulation 50 people wander around the environment and, if they are approaching an obstacle, they avoid it.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: type: ImageEnvironment parameters: [planimetry.png] _reactions: \u0026behavior - time-distribution: type: DiracComb parameters: [3.0] type: PrioritySteering actions: - type: HeadTowardRandomDirection - type: CognitiveAgentWander parameters: [6, 4] - type: CognitiveAgentObstacleAvoidance parameters: [4] deployments: - type: Circle parameters: [50, 0, 0, 25] properties: - type: Pedestrian - type: Perceptive2D - type: CircularArea - type: Social programs: - *behavior Steering Strategies In order to decide the logic according to which the different steering actions must be combined, the concept of steering strategy has been introduced and related to it different reactions are available to be used with the aim of computing the desired route for the pedestrians. If you want a pedestrian to execute a single steering action at a time, PrioritySteering is a reaction which gives relevance only to the steering action whose target point is the nearest to the current pedestrian position. If you want a pedestrian to execute a movement considering multiple actions at a time, BlendedSteering weights them considering their target distance to the current pedestrian position. There is no limit to the number of steering actions which can be used together but some messy compositions can result in unpredictable behaviors, so pay attention.\nIn the example below a pedestrian reaches a point of interest, avoiding in the meantime to approach another position.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: type: ContinuousPhysics2DEnvironment _reactions: \u0026behavior - time-distribution: type: DiracComb parameters: [1.0] type: BlendedSteering actions: - type: CognitiveAgentSeek parameters: [1000, 500] - type: CognitiveAgentFlee parameters: [500, -500] deployments: - type: Point parameters: [0, 0] properties: - type: Pedestrian - type: Perceptive2D - type: CircularArea - type: Social programs: - *behavior Danger and evacuations Pedestrians can be loaded in any kind of Environment but it is recommended to use PhysicsEnvironments since they have properties such as non-overlapping shapes which are advisable to be taken into consideration when working with a crowd. To specify the existence of a potential danger or a significative zone in general inside the environment you can use Layers. You must specify to any cognitive pedestrian the Molecule representing danger in the Environment, otherwise it won’t have the ability to recognize its presence.\nIn the following example, 100 adult females with cognitive capabilities get away from a zone in the environment where there is a potential danger.\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis variables: danger: \u0026danger formula: \"\\\"danger\\\"\" environment: type: ContinuousPhysics2DEnvironment layers: - type: BidimensionalGaussianLayer molecule: *danger parameters: [0.0, 0.0, 20.0, 15.0] _reactions: \u0026behavior - time-distribution: type: DiracComb parameters: [1.0] type: CognitiveBehavior actions: - type: CognitiveAgentAvoidLayer parameters: [*danger] deployments: - type: Circle parameters: [100, 0, 0, 50] properties: - type: Human parameters: [\"adult\", \"female\"] - type: Perceptive2D - type: CognitivePedestrian - type: Cognitive2D - type: CircularArea programs: - *behavior Hardcoded parameters Here’s a list of all the hardcoded parameters.\nName Value Description knownImpasseWeight 10 Weight assigned to known impasses (= areas with a single door). It’s usually a high value, allowing to avoid them. toleranceAngle 45 degrees Used by SinglePrevalent, that linearly combines multiple steering actions (= multiple forces) assuming one of them is prevalent. Weights for the linear combination are determined so that the resulting force forms with the prevalent one an angle smaller than or equal to the tolerance angle. The prevalent force usually wants to move the pedestrian consciously, whereas other forces are more “greedy”. The purpose of the tolerance angle is allowing to steer the pedestrian towards the target defined by the prevalent force, while using a trajectory which takes into account other urges as well. alpha 0.5 Used by SinglePrevalent, an exponential smoothing with this alpha is applied to the resulting force in order to reduce oscillatory movements. maxWalkRatio 0.3 Used by SinglePrevalent. When the pedestrian is subject to contrasting forces the resulting one may be small in magnitude, hence a lower bound for such quantity is set to (maximum distance walkable by the pedestrian) * (this parameter) so as to avoid extremely slow movements. delta 0.05 Used by SinglePrevalent. The weight assigned to disturbing forces is set to 1 and then iteratively decreased by delta until the resulting force satisfies the required conditions (see the api). This is similar to a gradient descent. Physical pedestrians Physical pedestrians are capable of pushing and bumping into each other. To express those physical interactions use a PhysicalPedestrian property.\nPhysical steering strategies In order to work properly, physical pedestrians should be equipped with physical steering strategies. Such strategies define how steering actions (which are intentional) are combined with physical forces (which are mostly unintentional). At present, only PhysicalBlendedSteering and NavigationPrioritizedSteeringWithPhysics are available.\nHere’s a simple code for loading a homogeneous pedestrian with physical properties with CognitiveAgentSeek and CognitiveAgentFlee:\nClick to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: type: EnvironmentWithDynamics parameters: path: planimetry.png zoom: 0.05 deployments: - type: Point parameters: [2, 2] properties: - type: Pedestrian - type: PhysicalPedestrian2D - type: Perceptive2D - type: CircularArea - type: Social programs: - time-distribution: type: DiracComb parameters: [1.0] type: PhysicalBlendedSteering actions: - type: CognitiveAgentSeek parameters: [1000, 500] - type: CognitiveAgentFlee parameters: [500, -500]",

    "content": "The simulator provides tools for exporting data automatically. An export section on the simulation file instructs which data is considered interesting, and should be thus exported with the selected sampling frequency. Data can be exported separately for each node, or can be aggregated on the fly using any univariate statistic function (e.g., mean, sum, product, percentile, median…). The treatment of missing or non-finite values can be specified as well. Results are exported in comma-separated values files, easily importable in a variety of data analysis tools.\nData export is realized by Exporters. Exporters are defined in the export section of the configuration, by specifying their type, their constructor parameters, and the data they should export. The elements under data must be instanceable implementations of Extractor.\nExport data as CSV Alchemist can export data to a custom comma-separated-values format.

All you have to do is mark the areas of the environment where to plant initial seeds in blue (RGB #0000FF). In the image below you can see the generation of a navigation graph. The blue regions in the original image indicate where to plant initial seeds. These are then grown and crossings are found between them.\nOnce you have your image ready for the generation of the navigation graph, you can exploit the ImageEnvironmentWithGraph class to produce it for you. This will read your image, extract the positions you marked blue and pass them to the NaviGator algorithm.\nExamples Click to show / hide code incarnation: protelis environment: type: ImageEnvironmentWithGraph parameters: [images/building-planimetry.png, 0.1] seeds: scenario: 0 simulation: 1 _reactions: \u0026behavior -

Navigation on maps can be done by using gps traces, by moving along roads (Alchemist relies on GraphHopper to provide directions), by interpolating gps traces with on-the-road-movements, or by ignoring the map information and just move as you would in a continuous space.\nSetting up a map environment In order to run simulations on real world maps, an appropriate environment must be selected, such as OSMEnvironment.\nIf you need map data to perform on-streets routing, you need to feed it to the simulator. OSMEnvironment supports OpenStreetMap extracts in several formats, we recommend using the protocol buffer binary format (pbf) to save time and space.\nOpenStreetMap extracts It is likely that you do not need a simulation that requires navigation capabilities on the whole planet, especially considering that, even in binary format, it contains more than 50GB of data. We recommend thus to use an extract with the data relative to the area you are interested in simulating in. One great way to obtain an extract is through BBBike.\nIf you rely on their service, consider donating to the project.\nDeploying nodes using GPS traces We prepared a dedicated page on the argument\nNavigate nodes in map environment We prepared a dedicated page on the argument",

    "content": "When Alchemist is used on computers with a large amount of memory and parallelism, additional configuration might be required.\nInfo These problems have more to do with the way memory allocation on Linux and the JVM works than with Alchemist itself. They are not memory leaks in Alchemist (hence the reason why they do not happen with smaller memory sizes).\nSymptoms batch execution slowing down (this is due to the memory pressure) analysis of memory shows that the amount of memory actually in use by the JVM is always growing (similar to a memory leak) the following (or similar) warning is displayed on the standard error on startup: [warning][gc] ***** WARNING! INCORRECT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION DETECTED! ***** [warning][gc] The system limit on number of memory mappings per process might be too low for the given [warning][gc] max Java heap size (101754M). Please adjust /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count to allow for at [warning][gc] least 183157 mappings (current limit is 65530). Continuing execution with the current [warning][gc] limit could lead to a premature OutOfMemoryError being thrown, due to failure to map memory. Solution Warning The file /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count could be changed manually, but these changes won’t persist reboots.\nA persistent solution to the problem is to instruct the system to always load the correct configuration. One possible way is to instruct sysctl through a configuration file (e.g., /etc/sysctl.d/99-vm-max-map-count.conf) including the following line: vm.max_map_count=\u003ccustom max_map_count\u003e.

    "content": "This section explains the pathfinding strategies and algorithms of Alchemist. Instructions on how to exercise them are available here.\nNavigation graphs A navigation graph of an environment with obstacles is a graph whose nodes are convex shapes representing portions of the environment which are traversable by agents (namely, walkable areas), and edges represent connections between them. The image below shows a bidimensional environment with obstacles on the left and the associated navigation graph on the right (nodes are painted blue, edges are represented as line segments connecting the centroid of a node to the associated crossing, which is painted green).\nNavigation graphs are mainly used for navigation purposes (e.g. in pathfinding algorithms): the advantage of decomposing the environment into convex regions is that agents can freely walk around within a convex region, as it is guaranteed that no obstacle will be found (remember that a shape is convex when no line segment between any two points on its boundary ever goes outside the shape).\nAlchemist is capable of generating navigation graphs of bidimensional environments featuring euclidean geometry and double precision coordinates. Before diving into the topic, please be aware that the algorithm implemented in Alchemist for the generation of navigation graphs:\nDoes not guarantee the coverage of 100% of the walkable area (as the image above shows). Is only capable to detect axis-aligned crossings. Is only capable to deal with convex polygonal obstacles. Concave ones can be decomposed into convex meshes, whereas for curves bounding boxes can be used, eventually arbitrarily-oriented minimum bounding boxes. NaviGator The algorithm implemented in Alchemist is called NaviGator (Navigation Graphs generAtor), here’s a brief description of how it operates: firstly, a certain number of seeds is planted in the environment. Each seed is a square-shaped region of unitary side that will grow maintaining a convex shape. Secondly, planted seeds are extended as far as possible (i.e. until they are in contact with an obstacle or another seed on each side). Finally, crossings are found between the grown seeds. NaviGator is derived from the DEACCON algorithm for the generation of navigation meshes.",

It has been developed on the solid foundation of Field Calculus, a theoretical model of aggregate programming, and it is written and interoperable with Java.\nLearning Protelis The language and all the machinery of Protelis are out of the scope of this tutorial. However, we warmly recommend to read this paper first, and then to deepen your knowledge of Protelis by reading the resources available in the official Protelis website.\nA tutorial similar to the base tutorial, with increasingly rich examples and focused on the Protelis incarnation can be found on GitHub. The README.md file of the project explains the use and the steps to follow.\nNote Something went wrong along the line? Drop us an issue report and we’ll get back to you.\nAlchemist tutorial with Protelis This tutorial includes a series of exercises of increasing complexity that showcase the Alchemist simulator's Protelis incarnation.\nHow to launch Prerequisites The only prerequisite is a Java version compatible with Gradle. This project is configured to automatically upgrade the version of Gradle it relies upon, so usually the last entry of the Gradle-Java compatibility matrix is the one to consider. At the time of writing, the minimum required version is Java 8. You can verify the version by running java -version in a terminal. In case you have no Java installed, we suggest to use the latest LTS version from AdoptOpenJDK.\nNote that, internally, the simulator requires Java 11 or above. The project is configured to self-provision a compatible Java environment, assuming that network connection is available.\nUsing Gradle The easiest way to launch the examples is by relying on the pre-configured Gradle build script. It will automatically download all the required libraries, set up the environment, and execute the simulator via command line for you.\nGradle has been preconfigured in this repository for executing available Alchemist simulations inside src/main/yaml/. For each such file, one Gradle task is generated. By executing ./gradlew tasks, these tasks will be displayed in the Run Alchemist tasks category, similar to (this may change):\nRun Alchemist tasks ------------------- run00-minimal - Launches simulation 00-minimal run01-nodes - Launches simulation 01-nodes run02-manynodes - Launches simulation 02-manynodes run03-grid - Launches simulation 03-grid run04-perturb-grid - Launches simulation 04-perturb-grid run05-content - Launches simulation 05-content run06-program - Launches simulation 06-program run07-gradient - Launches simulation 07-gradient runAll - Launches all simulations Alchemist uses JSON files for modelling effects with the classic Swing UI. If an effect file with the same name of the YAML simulation file is found in the effects folder, it will be loaded as default graphics file. If none is found, Alchemist will be started with the default effects set (you can always fiddle with the rendering from within the simulator).\nAs first step, use git to locally clone this repository.\nIn order to launch all simulations, open a terminal and move to the project root folder, then on UNIX:\n./gradlew runAll On Windows:\ngradlew.bat runAll Note that the first launch will be rather slow, since Gradle will download all the required files. They will get cached in the user's home folder (as per Gradle normal behavior).\nGraphic interface shortcuts The graphical interface that pops up when Alchemist is executed providing a YAML file on the command line is a stripped-down version of the one that shows when the simulator is invoked by java -jar or by double clicking.\nIn order to use such interface, consider the following command list:\nKey binding Active Effect L always (En/Dis)ables the painting of links between nodes M always (En/Dis)ables the painting of a marker on the closest node Mouse pan in normal mode Moves around Mouse wheel in normal mode Zooms in/out Double click in normal mode Opens a frame with the closest node information Right click in normal mode Enters screen rotation mode P always Plays/pauses the simulation R always Enables the real-time mode Left arrow always Speeds the simulation down (more calls to the graphics) Right arrow always Speeds the simulation up (less calls to the graphics) S always Enters / exits the select mode (nodes can be selected with the mouse) O in select mode Selected nodes can be moved by drag and drop E in select mode Enters edit mode (to manually change node contents)",

    "content": "The SAPERE incarnation for Alchemist was the first stable incarnation produced for the simulator. It was developed in the context of the SAPERE EU project.\nAt the core of SAPERE is the concept of Live Semantic Annotation (LSA), namely a description of a resource (sensor, service, actuator…) always mapping the current resource status (somewhat a prelude to the currently famous digital twin concept).\nThese annotations evolve following so-called Eco-Laws, mimicking the complex behaviours of natural ecosystems.\nThe SAPERE approach fostered subsequent approaches, such as aggregate computing.\nLive Semantic Annotations An LSA as modeled in Alchemist is a tuple of values. These tuples can be injected in nodes as data items. From the point of view of the Alchemist metamodel, the concept of Molecule is mapped to LSA (LsaMolecule). As a consequence, LSAs can be inserted in nodes.\nEco-Laws Tuple matching is used to define Eco-Laws. An Eco-Law is a rewriting rule very similar in concept to chemical reactions: elements on the left-hand side of the reaction are removed from the container, elements on the right-hand side are inserted instead.\nThe following program matches LSAs with two arguments, the former must be foo, the latter a number greater than 30, and produces in a new tuple having as first element bar and as second the opposite of the matched number:\n{ foo, def: N \u003e 30 } --\u003e { bar, -N }",

We do recommend either OpenJDK or OpenJ9 from AdoptOpenJDK. Several architectures, operating systems, and JDK versions are tested for compatibility.\nPrerequisites with docker When running with docker, installing Java Development Kit is not needed. Docker and docker-compose are needed in order to run this project in container. To run on OS X and Windows machines additional X Window System program will be needed. Eg. xquarts for OS X and Xming for Windows. To run run project use docker-compose up. Simulation can be specified eg. in docker-compose.yml file.\nLanching simulations The project is managed via the Gradle Build Tool. You do not need to install it, the launch script will download the correct version for you.\nIn order to launch a simulation named SIMNAME, a file named SIMNAME.yml must be in the src/main/yaml folder of the project. That's where the build script will look up. There will be one Gradle task for each simulation file, which can be executed as:\n./gradlew SIMNAME\nIf an effects file named SIMNAME.json is present in the effects folder, it will be loaded automatically.\nNOTE the environment variable CI is used to determined whether the task is running in a headless continuous integration environment. If you have CI=true in your environment, the graphical interface won't get pulled up.\nExercises Using the provided simulation and the documentation provided on the official Alchemist website, and in particular in reference guide to the YAML simulations and in the SAPERE incarnation reference, and the graphical interface usage description available here, try to solve the following exercises:\nAdd two nodes to an empty, continuous environment, and make them connected Create 10000 nodes randomly displaced inside a circle centered in (0,0) and radius 10 Create a grid of nodes from (-5,-5) to (5,5), with nodes every (0.25,0.25) distance units, and no perturbance Create a perturbed grid from the example above Put some {token} LSAs in some nodes of the system Write a \"dodgeball\" program See how YAML can be used to write personalised sections and how they can be referred Modify the dodgeball program so that it counts in the LSA the number of passes Write an LSA diffusion program: after some time, every node of the network must have the {token} LSA. Use the * operator Look at the 10-math.yml file. Esperiment with it and try to move nodes around manually. Write a gradient, it should: convert a {source} to a {gradient, 0} (don't delete the source!) diffuse to neighbors the gradient, whose value is increased of #D if there are multiple copies of the gradient, keep only the lowest (immediately!) every some time \"age\" the information by increasing its value delete gradients whose value is higher than some threshold (e.g. 20). Take a look to 12-sets.yml, and see how the set arithmetic works. Run it, and see the result. Modify the program above by changing the time distribution, using a personalised one: a DiracComb with parameter 0.5 Take a look to 14-yaml.vars.yml, and make sure to understand how the variables system works Take a look to 15-move.yml, run it and play with its variables Try to run 16-maps.yml (note: it can take some time on the first load). Get a glance of the possible complexity of advanced scenarios. Discuss the result, modify the example as you like. Note Something went wrong along the line? Drop us an issue report and we’ll get back to you.\nLSAs Syntax details are available in the reference. The following code creates an irregular grid of devices, of which those located around the center of such grid contain the tuple { token }:\nincarnation: sapere network-model: type: ConnectWithinDistance parameters: [0.5] deployments: type: Grid parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] contents: # A description of what will be included in the node - molecule: hello # Everywhere - in: # Restrict the area to... type: Rectangle # ...a class implementing Shape with this name... parameters: [-1, -1, 2, 2] # ...which can get built with these parameters molecule: token # Molecule to inject The relevant part here is molecule: token. If we wanted to inject the tuple { foo, 1, bar, 2 }, we could have written molecule: foo, 1, bar, 2.\nEco-Laws Nodes can be programmed with Eco-Laws as follows:\nincarnation: sapere network-model: type: ConnectWithinDistance parameters: [0.5] deployments: type: Grid parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] contents: - in: type: Rectangle parameters: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1] molecule: token programs: # A list of the sets of reactions programming the node - - time-distribution: 1 # Frequency. If the class is not specified, the implementation to use is chosen by the incarnation. The SAPERE incarnation automatically loads ExponentialTime, which takes a number representing the Markovian rate. # program lets the incarnation choose the class implementing Reaction, and passes down a string that, when parsed, produces the program program: \u003e # \"\u003e\" begins a multiline string (quote mode) {token} --\u003e {firing} # If the time distribution is unspecified, the SAPERE incarnation assumes a \"ASAP\" behavior (rate = Infinity) - program: \"{firing} --\u003e +{token}\" Eco-Laws can be programmed to send LSAs to neighbors, as well as to look into neighboring nodes for getting LSAs. In order to do so, the LSA template in the Eco-Law must be preceded by a neighbor operator, either + or *.\n+ means in a neighbor: if used on the left hand side, it considers the condition satisfied if at least one neighbor has at least one LSA matching the provided template; if used on the right hand side, sends the LSA to one random neighbor.\n* means in all neighbors: if used on the left hand side, it considers the condition satisfied if all neighbors have at least one LSA matching the provided template; if used on the right hand side, sends a copy of the LSA to all neighbors.\nThe following code exemplifies a diffusion program: when { token } is present locally, it is copied into neighboring nodes once per second; and as soon as two copies of { token } are present, one gets removed.\nincarnation: sapere network-model: type: ConnectWithinDistance parameters: [0.5] _send: \u0026send - time-distribution: 1 program: \u003e {token} --\u003e {token} *{token} - program: \u003e {token}{token} --\u003e {token} deployments: type: Grid parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] contents: in: type: Rectangle parameters: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1] molecule: token programs: *send Rates The time distribution with which reactions should get scheduled can be controlled by thinkering with the yaml specification as per every reaction in Alchemist. If no TimeDistribution is specified, the Eco-Law is assumed to run “as soon as possible” (ASAP).\nThis may lead to unwanted behaviour. For instance, programming a single node with: --\u003e { foo } will cause the simulation to schedule a reaction producing { foo } at time zero, and at each execution the time will remain zero: the simulator will be producing copies over copies of the tuple, never advancing in time (Alchemist is a discrete event simulator), and possibly going on until the JVM memory limit is reached.\nIf a number is specified as time distribution, using the time-distribution key, then it will be interpreted as the Markovian rate of an exponentially distributed time.\nOther distributions found at it.unibo.alchemist.model.timedistributions can be used leveraging the arbitrary class loading system.\nIn the following example, two Eco-Laws are configured, and one of them is bound to an ExponentialTime with rate 1, namely, when the reaction can be executed (the left hand LSAs have local matches), it will execute at an average of once per second (with a variance of 1 s²).\nincarnation: sapere network-model: type: ConnectWithinDistance parameters: [0.5] deployments: type: Grid parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1] contents: - in: type: Rectangle parameters: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1] molecule: token programs: # A list of the sets of reactions programming the node - - time-distribution: 1 # Frequency. If the class is not specified, the implementation to use is chosen by the incarnation. The SAPERE incarnation automatically loads ExponentialTime, which takes a number representing the Markovian rate. # program lets the incarnation choose the class implementing Reaction, and passes down a string that, when parsed, produces the program program: \u003e # \"\u003e\" begins a multiline string (quote mode) {token} --\u003e {firing} # If the time distribution is unspecified, the SAPERE incarnation assumes a \"ASAP\" behavior (rate = Infinity) - program: \"{firing} --\u003e +{token}\" Exercise To better grasp details of the incarnation, we recommend looking at the examples available on the Alchemist SAPERE Incarnation tutorial on GitHub.\nBesides examples with growing complexity, there are a number of proposed exercises that should help you get acquainted with the SAPERE way of writing self-organizing behaviors.",

    "content": "ScaFi (Scala Fields) is a Scala-based library and framework for Aggregate Programming. It implements a variant of the Higher-Order Field Calculus (HOFC) operational semantics, which is made available as a usable domain-specific language (DSL), and provides a platform and API for simulating and executing Aggregate Computing systems and applications.\nHow to use ScaFi with Alchemist For more details about ScaFi please read the documentation in the official site where you can find a description of how to integrate ScaFi toolkit with Alchemist.\nA tutorial similar to the base tutorial, with increasingly rich examples, focused on the Scafi incarnation.\nThe tutorial can be found on GitHub. The README.md file of the project explains the use and the steps to follow.\nSimulations with Alchemist and Scafi: tutorial This tutorial presents a sequence of increasingly rich examples using the Scafi aggregate programming DSL and the Alchemist Simulator.\nRequirements A Gradle-compatible Java version e.g., temurin A local installation of Git [Optional] A working version of Python 3 for the plotting part Check if it works\nOpen a terminal and type\njava -version git --version Now you are ready to launch Alchemist \u0026 ScaFi simulations\nQuickstart Open a terminal and run:\nWindows\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist/master/launch.ps1 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | powershell.exe Linux \u0026 Mac\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist/master/launch.sh | bash It will take some time for the system to download all the required dependencies, at the end of the process you will be presented the Alchemist default GUI (here are instructions on how to interact with the simulator). At this point, the simulation should be looking like this: Click P to start the simulation. The nodes will compute the ScaFi program described here) in rounds, producing node colour changes. What happened Issuing the one-liner command, you have:\ndownloaded this repository using Git created a folder called learning-scafi-alchemist that contains the simulations executed the command ./gradlew runHelloScafi inside the learning-scafi-alchemist created above. The last command produces the execution of the simulation called helloScafi described using a yml file. Particularly an Alchemist simulation typically consists of a network of devices that could communicate with each other by means of a neighbourhood relationship (you can see the connections by clicking L) In this case, the nodes’ positions are configured through real GPS traces from the Vienna marathon app. The simulation effects (i.e., node shapes and colours) are highly configurable through JSON configuration. Here the node colour depends on the output of the ScaFi program, which is executed in each device every 1 second. Particularly, the execution of a ScaFi program deals with local computations and interaction among neighbours through a distributed data structure called computational field. This distributed and repeated execution of rounds eventually produces a collective result (you can find more details about the execution model of ScaFi programs in the documentation).\nIn this case, the program consists of the evaluation of the distance from the node with the ID 100 (in Aggregate Computing literature called “gradient”).\nSomething wrong?\nTry the following:\nclone manually using git clone https://github.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist.git alternatively: download the repository zip (Download!) then unzip the repository to a local folder open a terminal inside the cloned/downloaded folder run ./gradlew runHelloScafi If you still have problems executing the experiments, please consider opening an issue! New issues\nGuided examples from now on, we will assume all commands have been issued inside learning-scafi-alchemist\n1. Hello, ScaFi! A gradient in space and time Launch command ./gradlew runHelloScafi What happened This is the example described in Quickstart section. Particularly, the program consists of the description of the self-healing gradient: an algorithm that computes a gradient (i.e., a field mapping each device in the system with its minimum distance from the closest source device) field and automatically adjusts it after changes in the source set and the connectivity network (more details about gradients can be found in Compositional Blocks for Optimal Self-Healing Gradients).\nWhat is inside Configuration File ScaFi Program File helloScafi.yml HelloScafi.scala An Alchemist simulation could be described through yml configurations. In order to execute ScaFi script, you should at least define:\nthe Scafi incarnation: incarnation: scafi a Reaction that contains the Action RunScafiProgram with the full class name of the program chosen _reactions: - program: \u0026program - time-distribution: type: ExponentialTime parameters: [*programRate] type: Event actions: - type: RunScafiProgram parameters: [it.unibo.scafi.examples.HelloScafi, *retentionTime] - program: send a deployment that contains in the programs the Action specified above deployments: ## i.e, how to place nodes type: FromGPSTrace ## place nodes from gps traces parameters: [*totalNodes, *gpsTraceFile, true, \"AlignToTime\", *timeToAlign, false, false] programs: ## the reactions installed in each nodes - *program More details about the Alchemist configuration could be found in the official guide.\nThe main logic of the node behaviour is described through the Scafi program file. Particularly, a valid ScaFi program must:\nchoose an incarnation import it.unibo.alchemist.model.scafi.ScafiIncarnationForAlchemist._ extend the AggregateProgram trait class HelloScafi extends AggregateProgram mix-in the libraries required for the application with StandardSensors with ScafiAlchemistSupport with BlockG with Gradients with FieldUtils { define the behaviour inside the main method. A ScaFi program typically deals with environment information through sensors. sense[Type](name) is the built-in operator used to query the sensors attached to each node. Each molecule expressed in the yaml (i.e., the Alchemist variable concept) can be queried from the ScaFi program. For instance, in helloScafi, we write:\n- molecule: test concentration: *source # anchor to \"source\" value, check line 17 Therefore, in the program, we can get the test value as:\n// Access to node state through \"molecule\" val source = sense[Int](\"test\") // Alchemist API =\u003e node.get(\"test\") There are several built-sensors (in checkSensors there are examples of local sensors and neighbouring sensors). For more details, please check the Scaladoc.\nThe main logic of the program is expressed in the following line:\n// An aggregate operation val g = classicGradient(mid() == source) Where classicGradient is a function defined in BlockG that implements the self-healing gradient described above. The first argument is a Boolean field that defines which part of the system could be considered a source zone. In this case, nodes are marked as source when the field of ids (i.e., mid()) is equal to the value passed through the variable test. This can be expressed as mid() == source.\nThe value produced by Scafi definitions could be used to express actuation. In the Scafi incarnation, you can update the Alchemist variables through node.put\n// Write access to node state (i.e., Actuation =\u003e it changes the node state) node.put(\"g\", g) In the Alchemist default GUI you can inspect the node variables (i.e., molecules) by double-clicking a nodes Finally, the last instruction of the main is the returned value of the Scafi program (in scala return is optional)\n// Return value of the program g Minimal changes As described above, the program is self-healing, so try to move node and see how the system eventually reaches a stable condition: click S to enter into selection mode start a selection by clicking the mouse left button and dragging it into the environment once your selection is over, click O to enter into move mode click over the selection and drag the element into another position Try to modify the source node (via yml configuration) and check the program output differences Try to change the source node (i.e. with the ID == 10) after 10 seconds (check BlockT library, or you can implement the time progression with rep(0 seconds)(time =\u003e time + deltaTime)) Using the generated data with the embedded plotting script You can produce plots from the data generated by Alchemist simulations. Indeed, each Alchemist simulation produces aggregated data as expressed in the export configuration section. For more details about data exporting, please refer to the official Alchemist guide.\nParticularly, this command:\n./gradlew runHelloScafi -Pbatch=true -Pvariables=random will run several simulations in batch, one for each possible value of the random variables (six in this case, as expressed in the helloScafi.yml). Each simulation, will produce a csv file in $exportPath/$fileNameRoot-randomValue.$fileExtension (in this case, build/exports/helloScafi/experiment-x.txt, the values starting with $ are gathered from the simulation configuration file).\nTypically, we use these data to produce charts that express the dynamics of the collective system. This repository contains a highly configurable script (please look at the configuration defined in plots).\nTo run the script for this experiment, you should run:\n$ python plotter.py plots/helloScafi.yml ./build/exports/helloScafi \".*\" \"result\" plots/ Where:\nthe first argument is the plot configuration (expressed using a yaml file) the second argument is where the files are located the third argument is a regex used to select the simulations file the fourth argument defines the initial names of the plot the last argument devises the folder in which the plots will be stored 2. A richer pattern: Self-organizing Coordination Regions Launch command ./gradlew runSelforgCoordRegions What happened This example shows an interesting pattern developed with ScaFi, the so-called Self-Organising Coordination Regions (SCR). (more details in Self-organising Coordination Regions: A Pattern for Edge Computing)\nThe idea of SCR is to organize a distributed activity into multiple spatial regions (inducing a partition of the system), each one controlled by a leader device, which collects data from the area members and spreads decisions to enact some area-wide policy. Particularly, when you launch the command of SCR you will see something like this:\nWhere the colour denotes the potential field (i.e., the gradient) that starts from the selected leader. In this GIF, the leaders are the ones marked with blue colour.\nWhat is inside Configuration File ScaFi Program File selforgCoordRegions.yml SelforganisingCoordinationRegions.scala The SCR pattern consists of four main phases:\nleader election: using block S the system will produce a distributed leader election that tries to divide the system equally with a certain range (in S term, it is called grain): // Sparse choice (leader election) of the cluster heads val leader = S(sense(Params.GRAIN), metric = nbrRange) potential field definition: after the leader election process, there is another phase in which will be computed potential field from the leader. In this way, the slave node could send information to leader’s // G block to run a gradient from the leaders val g = distanceTo(leader, metric = nbrRange) collection phase: the slave node could collect local information (e.g., temperature) and send it to the leader. During the path, it will be an aggregation process that combines local information with area information (i.e., all the nodes that are inside the potential field of a leader) // C block to collect information towards the leaders val c = C[Double,Set[ID]](g, _++_, Set(mid()), Set.empty) leader choice and share: with the information collected inside an area, the leader could perform an area-wide decision and then send it to the whole area (using G) // G block to propagate decisions or aggregated info from leaders to members val info = G[Set[ID]](leader, c, identity, metric = nbrRange) val head = G[ID](leader, mid(), identity, metric = nbrRange) Minimal changes Try to change the grain (check in the configuration file). It would lead to changes in area formation Try to count the number of nodes inside an area and share this information with that area—suggestion: change phase 3. of the SCR As in the previous example, the areas are self-healing. Therefore try to move leaders and see what happens in the leader formation. Try to remove nodes too (see the next clip) 3. Overlapping computations in space and time with aggregate processes ./gradlew runAggregateProcesses What happened This example shows an application of Aggregate Processes, which is s a way to specify a dynamic number of collective computations running on dynamic ensembles of devices (more details in Engineering collective intelligence at the edge with aggregate processes). The processes are the bigger circle around the nodes. The colour identifies the process ID. As you can see, during the simulation the process starts, shrink and then could disappear.\nWhat is inside Configuration File ScaFi Program File aggregateProcesses.yml SelforganisingCoordinationRegions.scala Minimal changes To start the process, you can use the spawn operators (and their variation, sspawn, cspawn, etc.):\nval maps = sspawn[Pid,Unit,Double](process, pids, {}) Particularly, sspawn accepts:\nthe process logic, that is a function ID =\u003e Input =\u003e Pout[Out] ID in this case is a case class that contains the id of a node that will start the process, the time in which it will effectively start and finally the time in which it will end. case class Pid(src: ID = mid(), time: Long = alchemistTimestamp.toDouble.toLong) (val terminateAt: Long = Long.MaxValue) The input of the process (in this case is empty) Finally, the Pout[Double] is the process output. Pout is a data structure that contains the output of the process and the status of the process (that could be Output, Terminated and External—more details in the paper). The key set of the process that will be spawn (pids) In this case, the new pids associated to new processes are selected from Alchemist molecule. def processesSpec: Map[Int,(Int,Int)] = sense(MOLECULE_PROCS) From this information il will be created the pids for the processes: // Determine the processes to be generated (these are provided in a molecule \"procs\") val procs: Set[ProcessSpec] = processesSpec.map(tp =\u003e ProcessSpec.fromTuple(tp._1, tp._2)).toSet val t = alchemistTimestamp.toDouble.toLong val pids: Set[Pid] = procs.filter(tgen =\u003e tgen.device == mid() \u0026\u0026 t \u003e tgen.startTime \u0026\u0026 (t - 5) \u003c tgen.startTime) .map(tgen =\u003e Pid(time = tgen.startTime)(terminateAt = tgen.endTime)) Particularly, in this case, the process logic is quite simple:\nit produces a potential field from the processes creator it terminates if the terminateAt is reached the nodes that belong to nodes are the ones that are inside the bubble, that is the nodes inside an area of 200 units def process(pid: Pid)(src: Unit = ()): POut[Double] = { val g = classicGradient(pid.src==mid()) val s = if(pid.src==mid() \u0026\u0026 pid.terminateAt.toDouble \u003c= alchemistTimestamp.toDouble){ Terminated } else if(g \u003c 200) Output else External POut(g, s) } Minimal changes Try to add the extension of the bubble as a parameter (as the start and end time) Even in this case, the computation is self-healing. Therefore, try to move the process center to see how the system reacts Try to add other processess (see the yaml configuration) External resources to improve your understanding The Alchemist metamodel: https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/explanation/ The Alchemist Simulator reference https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/reference/yaml/ ScaFi documentation: https://scafi.github.io/docs/ Main scientific papers about ScaFI (and that use ScaFi): https://scafi.github.io/papers/ Note Something went wrong along the line?

Color of pixels that represents obstacles can be set to every color with a constructor’s parameter, black is default.\nBy default, each pixel is considered as a 1x1 block. As a consequence, a 1200x600 image with a vertical line of black pixels at coordinate 500 will be interpreted as a single obstacle of size 1x600 starting at coordinate (500, 0).

Available values: aggregate - only the state after the batch processing is sent to the monitors replay - all the state changes get sent to the monitors ordered by scheduled time. Fixed Size Batch Engine Fixed size batch engine processes events in parallel in batches of fixed size.\nSample configuration:\nengine-configuration: type: FixedBatchEngineConfiguration parameters: outputReplayStrategy: aggregate batchSize: 4 Epsilon Batch Engine Epsilon dynamic size batch engine processes events in parallel in batches constructed using the epsilon sensitivity value. Events get added to the batch as long as the difference in scheduled time is lesser than the given epsilon value.\nSample configuration:\nengine-configuration: type: EpsilonBatchEngineConfiguration parameters: outputReplayStrategy: aggregate epsilonValue: 0.01 0.01 is a reasonable baseline, experiment to find the best value for your case.",

    "content": "Prerequisites This guide assumes you already know the Alchemist metamodel and that you keep the YAML reference at your fingertips.\nSmartcam A smartcam is a camera able to detect objects of interest and to communicate with other smartcameras. In many cases it is also assumed to be mounted on a drone as to be able to freely move around in the environment. In Alchemist, smartcams are simulated as Nodes equipped with specific Reactions defining their capabilities and behaviour. Single capabilities are expressed as Actions.\nVision The most basic example of a camera is a Node containing a Reaction with the CameraSee action.\nWarning Note: the CameraSee action currently only works in 2D environments supporting euclidean geometry, for example Continuous2DEnvironment.\nCameraSee requires the following parameters:\nthe distance of the field of view, its angle in degrees, and the name of the Molecule which will contain the ouput, namely, the list of nodes contained in the field of view, which is updated every time the action is triggered, optionally, a fourth parameter can be defined in order to filter the output, such parameter is expected to be the name of a Molecule which has to be contained in a Node for it to be visible, e.g., if it is wanted then only nodes containing a molecule named wanted will be seen. Movement The ability to move can be defined using movement actions such as MoveToTarget or FollowAtDistance.\nMoveToTarget expects 2 parameters:\nthe name of the molecule containing the target’s position, and the movement speed. FollowAtDistance requires:\nthe name of the molecule containing the target’s position, the distance to mantain from the target, and the movement speed. Rotation HeadTowardTarget can be used to instruct cameras to always face the specified target.\nSpin only requires the angular speed and will make the camera spin around itself like a radar.\nOther behavior Without defining an algorithm the cameras wouldn’t do anything interesting. Algorithms can be definied in a moltitude of different ways, depending on the incarnation. Usually, camera readings are used as sensors that get read by, e.g., Protelis or Scafi programs.\nFurther references Lukas Esterle, Peter R.

As per the map information, regional extracts are available (the full data pack is otherwise larger than 50GB uncompressed).\nAlignment of time Often, GPS traces are collected at different points in time. When this is the case, a strategy must be concted to “align” them: for instance, we may want all traces to be interpreted as beginning at the same time, regardless of the actual time they were taken; or we might want to discard the first hour of data; or maybe we want to use them just as they are.\nAlignment is performed by the subclasses of it.unibo.alchemist.boundary.gps\nThe strategies available to align time of GPS trace are the following:\nNoAlignment No alignment is performed, traces are left untouched.\nTrace Original time samples Aligned time samples A [2, 5] [2, 5] B [4, 6] [4, 6] AlignToFirstTrace: All traces get aligned to the start time of the first trace, keeping their relative distance.\nTrace Original time samples Aligned time samples A [2, 5] [0, 3] B [4, 6] [2, 4] AlignToSimulationTime: Aligns all traces to the initial simulation time, not preserving relative time differences.\nTrace Original time samples Aligned time samples A [2, 5] [0, 3] B [4, 6] [0, 2] AlignToTime: Aligns all traces with the given time in seconds from Epoch.

This augmentation offers a more organized and predictable approach for interacting with the simulator, thanks to static typing and schema definition.\nIt is possible to use GraphQL APIs for the development of a module inside Alchemist. The GraphQLClient class will take care of establishing a connection to the GraphQL server, validate and compute operations and return their results. This component has been developed in a multiplatform environment, so that applications can run on platforms like Android, iOS, Kotlin/JS or Kotlin/Native.\nCreate a new Query, Mutation, or Subscription In order to create new queries, mutations, or subscriptions, follow these steps:\nInclude the alchemist-graphql common source set in your project. implementation(alchemist(\"graphql\")) Define the structure of the data you need when executing one of the provided operations, inside a set of files with .graphql extension placed in the alchemist-graphql/src/commonMain/resources/graphql/ directory. The following is an example of a query that retrieves the contents of a node by its ID: # NodeQuery.graphql query Node($id: Int!) { nodeById(id: $id) { contents { entries { molecule { name } concentration } } } } Use GraphiQL to build client’s operations files You can test the structure of the data that you need inside the GraphiQL playground, in order to get predicable results when compiling your operations. GraphiQL also notices you if you are writing incorrect operations with useful explanation about the errors.\nRun the Gradle task ./gradlew :alchemist-graphql:generateApolloSources in order to generate Kotlin’s source code that represents the results of operations called in previously defined files.\nUse the defined GraphQL compiled operations on top of the GraphQLClient to execute them.\nval client: GraphQLClient = GraphQLClientFactory.basicClient() /* `NodeQuery` is the generated code for the GraphQL operation defined in the example above */ val node: Node? = client.query(NodeQuery(nodeId = 10)).execute().data",
